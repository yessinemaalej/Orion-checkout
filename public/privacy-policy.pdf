# Privacy Policy PDF Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the Privacy Policy PDF file.
In a real implementation, you would replace this with an actual PDF document containing your privacy policy.

The PDF should include:
- Information collection practices
- How personal data is used
- Data sharing policies
- Security measures
- User rights
- Cookie policy
- Contact information for privacy concerns
- Data retention policies

Please create and upload your actual Privacy Policy PDF to replace this placeholder.
