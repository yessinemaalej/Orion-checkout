# Terms of Service PDF Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the Terms of Service PDF file.
In a real implementation, you would replace this with an actual PDF document containing your terms of service.

The PDF should include:
- Service description
- User obligations
- Payment terms
- Shipping and delivery terms
- Warranty information
- Limitation of liability
- Dispute resolution
- Contact information

Please create and upload your actual Terms of Service PDF to replace this placeholder.
